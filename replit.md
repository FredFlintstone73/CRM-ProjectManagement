## Key Components

### Database Schema
The application uses a comprehensive schema with the following main entities:

1. **Users**: Authentication and profile management (required for Replit Auth)
2. **Contacts**: Unified contact management with types (client, prospect, team_member, strategic_partner)
3. **Projects**: Project lifecycle management with client associations
4. **Tasks**: Task management with project assignments and priority levels
5. **Project Templates**: Reusable project structures
6. **Communication Tracking**: Email interactions and call transcripts
7. **Activity Logging**: Comprehensive audit trail for all system actions
8. **Sessions**: Session storage for authentication persistence

### Frontend Components
- **Layout Components**: Sidebar navigation, header with quick actions
- **Dashboard**: Stats cards, recent activity, project status, upcoming tasks
- **Contact Management**: Contact forms, search/filter, type-based categorization
- **Project Management**: Project forms, progress tracking, client associations
- **Task Management**: Task forms, priority/status management, project assignments
- **UI Components**: Comprehensive component library based on Radix UI primitives

### API Endpoints
- **Authentication**: `/api/auth/*` - User authentication and session management
- **Dashboard**: `/api/dashboard/*` - Statistics and activity feeds
- **Contacts**: `/api/contacts/*` - CRUD operations for contacts
- **Projects**: `/api/projects/*` - CRUD operations for projects
- **Tasks**: `/api/tasks/*` - CRUD operations for tasks
- **Templates**: `/api/templates/*` - Project template management
- **Communications**: `/api/communications/*` - Email and call tracking

## Data Flow

### Authentication Flow
1. User accesses protected routes
2. Replit Auth middleware validates session
3. User information stored in PostgreSQL sessions table
4. Frontend receives user data through `/api/auth/user` endpoint
5. React Query manages authentication state globally

### Data Management Flow
1. Frontend components use React Query for server state
2. API requests include credentials for session validation
3. Express routes validate authentication before processing
4. Drizzle ORM handles database operations with type safety
5. Activity logging automatically tracks all data changes
6. Real-time updates through query invalidation

### Form Handling
1. React Hook Form manages form state and validation
2. Zod schemas provide runtime validation
3. Form submissions trigger API calls through React Query mutations
4. Success/error states managed through toast notifications
5. Query cache automatically updated on successful operations

- **File Serving**: Vite dev server for frontend assets
- **Live Reload**: Replit-specific runtime error modal and cartographer

### Production Environment
- **Build Process**: 
  - Frontend: Vite builds React app to `dist/public`
  - Backend: esbuild bundles server code to `dist/index.js`
- **Database**: Production Neon Database with connection pooling
- **Authentication**: Production Replit Auth configuration
- **Static Assets**: Express serves built frontend from `dist/public`
- **Process Management**: Node.js process running bundled server code

### Database Management
- **Schema**: Centralized in `shared/schema.ts` for type sharing
- **Migrations**: Automated through Drizzle Kit
- **Connection**: Pooled connections via Neon's serverless driver
- **Environment**: DATABASE_URL environment variable for connection string

The architecture prioritizes type safety, developer experience, and scalability while maintaining simplicity in deployment and maintenance. The shared schema approach ensures consistency between frontend and backend, while the modular component structure supports easy feature extension and maintenance.
