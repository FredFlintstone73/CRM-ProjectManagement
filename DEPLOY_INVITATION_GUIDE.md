# Complete Invitation System Deployment Guide

## Problem Summary
The invitation codes exist in your **development database** but your **deployed app uses a separate production database**. This is why invitation links work in development but fail in production.

## SOLUTION: Deploy and Create Fresh Invitations

### Step 1: Deploy Your Current Code
1. Deploy your current version to ensure the deployed app has the latest invitation system fixes
2. The deployed app will use its own production database

### Step 2: Create Invitations Through Deployed App
1. **Go to deployed app**: https://crm-project-management.replit.app
2. **Log in as administrator** (your account)
3. **Navigate to User Management** (in sidebar)
4. **Create new invitations** for each team member through the interface
5. **Copy the generated invitation links**
6. **Send those links to your team**

### Step 3: Team Member Instructions
When team members receive the new invitation links:
1. Click the invitation link
2. Log in with their Replit account  
3. Click "Accept Invitation"
4. Complete 2FA setup when prompted

## Why This Happens
- **Development**: Uses development database (where we created test codes)
- **Production**: Uses separate production database (empty of test codes)
- **Solution**: Create codes in production database via deployed app

## Technical Details
The enhanced debugging will now show:
- Which database environment is being used
- What invitation codes exist in that specific database
- Detailed error information for troubleshooting

## Current Test Codes (For Development Only)
These codes exist in development database but NOT in production:

| Name | Email | Code |
|------|-------|------|
| Alex | alex@alignedadvisors.com | `ALEX2025` |
| Devyn | devyn@alignedadvisors.com | `DEVYN2025` |
| Megan | megan@alignedadvisors.com | `MEGAN2025` |
| Taylor | taylor@alignedadvisors.com | `TAYLOR2025` |
| Mike | mike@alignedadvisors.com | `MIKE2025` |

## Next Steps
1. **Deploy current code** to production
2. **Use deployed app User Management** to create fresh invitations
3. **Test one invitation** to confirm it works
4. **Share working links** with your team

The invitations created through the deployed app will definitely work since they'll exist in the correct production database.
