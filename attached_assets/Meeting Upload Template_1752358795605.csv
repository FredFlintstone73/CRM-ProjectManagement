This particular Deliverables Checkpoint:tm: is one of a very few which will actually occur at the client progress meeting, not before.  

Since this checkpoint will bring-in our Ideal Clients to this conversation to identify risks, it is important that our Subject Matter Experts understand that, even after their thorough insurance review, there may be new information or risks which need to be considered after this client progress meeting
    The Financial Planning Subject Matter Expert has coordinated with the Insurance Subject Matter Expert (and other Deliverables Team Members) to identify all significant risks to this client's plan, building scenarios, projections and strategies for each

Preparing for DRPM,Nominations and Deliverable Checkpoints Due,Click on subtask below for list of reports ,Estate Planner,,EP07  Determine the Necessity of a Life Insurance Trust,"Trust ownership is considered for all current and future life insurance otherwise owned by this client.
Life insurance trusts may be established for a variety of estate planning purposes, including:

To provide security for an Ideal Client's family after the death of the insured while providing control over how the death proceeds are invested or distributed to their beneficiaries
To provide liquidity to your Ideal Client's estate to pay debts and obligations, such as estate taxes
Life insurance trusts may be either revocable or irrevocable
It is possible that placing life insurance in an irrevocable life insurance trust could give Ideal Clients more control over their insurance policies and the money that is paid from them. It also may reduce or even eliminate estate taxes in some parts of the world, so more of your Ideal Client's estate can go to their heirs.
Often the goal of an irrevocable life insurance trust is to reduce or eliminate estate taxes. For Ideal Clients who have a large life insurance policy, the worry is that the life insurance policy will pay out into the estate, increasing the size of the taxable estate – and the possibility that the estate may owe estate taxes.  Sometimes these life policies can be placed into an irrevocable life insurance trust so that the proceeds of the life insurance are not added to your Ideal Client's estate upon death (reducing the size of the estate for estate-tax purposes)
Life Insurance Trusts have both advantages and disadvantages, all of which will be detailed in writing as a result of considering this Deliverables Checkpoint:tm:",,12/19/2025,

Preparing for DRPM,Nominations and Deliverable Checkpoints Due,Click on subtask below for list of reports ,Financial Planner,,FP05  Establish Strategy for the Purchase of Next Major Asset,"Point of View (POV): You should be aware of the target date and timing of discussions prior to every major purchase by a client as well as client goals and reach-out to Ideal Clients prior to every goal target date (at the preceding client progress meetings).  Note this client's next major purchase and schedule those discussions on The Greatest Probability Strategy:tm: (GPS).
Ensure that the study of the quickest, least expensive and time saving method of acquiring the next major purchase (e.g. vehicle sales process) has been recommended to this client well in-advance of every major purchase.
Smaller goals may be discussed just two client progress meetings prior to the goal target date.  Certain ""huge"" goals, such as ""financial independence"" require substantially longer lead-time to set up the goal funding distributions.  Your job is to set the number of meetings prior to the goal target date that goal funding distributions discussions need to begin.  Once set, document these planned discussions on both The Greatest Probability Strategy:tm: (GPS) and The Goal Blueprint:tm: for each goal.
Your Tax Planning Subject Matter Expert is the back-up for this checkpoint because there are often tax issues which need to be considered prior to many major purchases
You have an opportunity here to make life easier for your clients, as Financial Planning Subject Matter Expert do a little research and use your skill, experience and special knowledge to document a process for each of the following scenarios using The Best Way:tm: method:
    Vehicle purchasing (discussed more specifically in 8D8 & 7V6)
    Boat purchasing

NOTE: If assets are pledged as collateral the loan document, or debt agreement, may specify the frequency and means for valuing the collateral.  If collateral values drop, then the loan agreement may require additional collateral.  Proactive planning will eliminate any surprises (unexpected request for additional collateral).",,12/19/2025,
Preparing for DRPM,Nominations and Deliverable Checkpoints Due,Click on subtask below for list of reports ,Financial Planner,,FP16  Minimum Cash Levels Calculated for Each Account,"Point of View (POV): Several accounts for this client may have ""cash equivalent"" balances within them.  We need to be certain that the cash balances in those accounts are at the level required (for planned distributions, as a part of the investment asset allocation, etc).  To ensure the right amount of ""cash"" is in each account, we will set a target amount for ""cash"" in every one of these accounts.  We'll call this target cash balance the ""par level"" since the balance will often vary above & below that target amount.
Deliverables Checkpoint:tm:
The proper amount of “cushion”, cash (or cash equivalents), needed in each and every financial asset account (including the checking (operating) accounts, has been calculated and funded within the past four months.
If regular or systematic withdrawals are being made from any account ensure there is adequate ""cash"" in each account to cover those distributions until the next cash ""par level"" review. EXAMPLE: ""If an account has a monthly systematic withdrawal established and there is not enough cash to fulfill those automatic monthly withdrawals prior to the next review, like this, of the cash-par levels, then the cash target for this hypothetical account needs to be increased to accommodate the automatic withdrawals as well as an action item to actually increase the ""cash"" in that account to the new target par level""
Definition of ""Par Level"": A term often used in inventory accounting, ""par level"" is the specified amount of inventory an enterprise wishes to have at a certain location.  In this context, think of every financial account belonging to this client as a certain location where there exists and inventory of, often various, holdings.  The inventory could be stocks, bonds, mutual funds, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), Index funds, and cash (or cash equivalents).  Some accounts only hold cash (or cash equivalents). So the ""Cash"" Par-level for this account is the ""cash"" target amount set by the Subject Matter Expert for each account to be able to determine quickly whether each account possesses sufficient ""cash""  until the next ""Cash"" Par-level review.",,12/19/2025,

Definition:
""Identity Theft"" is the fraudulent acquisition and use of a person's private identifying information, usually for financial gain. ""Identity Theft"" is the crime of obtaining the personal or financial information of another person for the sole purpose of assuming that person's name or identity in order to make transactions or purchases.

Also, if any individual, or business entity, owes this client a significant amount of money then that person's credit rating should be spot-checked to re-assess our confidence that the money will be repaid.
