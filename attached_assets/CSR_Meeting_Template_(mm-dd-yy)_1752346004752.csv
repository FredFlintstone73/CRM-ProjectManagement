This particular Deliverables Checkpoint:tm: is one of a very few which will actually occur at the client progress meeting, not before.  

Since this checkpoint will bring-in our Ideal Clients to this conversation to identify risks, it is important that our Subject Matter Experts understand that, even after their thorough insurance review, there may be new information or risks which need to be considered after this client progress meeting
    The Financial Planning Subject Matter Expert has coordinated with the Insurance Subject Matter Expert (and other Deliverables Team Members) to identify all significant risks to this client's plan, building scenarios, projections and strategies for each
    Trusted Advisor completes The Comprehensive Safety Review Exercise :tm: with each client to harvest their views of the most significant risks to their plan (often completely different issues)

Since this Deliverables Checkpoint:tm: exercise will occur at this client progress meeting, the only information due before The Dry-Run Prep Meeting:tm: deadline could be, for example, to alert the team if this exercise might be skipped during the meeting.  For example, if this client is embroiled in a crisis or perhaps is in the middle of a major planning situation (sale of business, etc), then The Comprehensive Safety Review Exercise:tm: might be preempted and deferred to the following client progress meeting.",,Client Service Rep - Meeting Packets ,,,,

1.21021E+15,EP06  Determine if Tax Laws or Client Situations Have an Effect on a Client's Estate Plan,,,,,,,"Estate plan has been thoroughly reviewed by estate attorney, in consultation with the Tax SME, within four months of any significant change in estate or relevant tax laws or circumstances within this client’s estate.",,Estate Planner,,,,
1.21021E+15,EP07  Determine the Necessity of a Life Insurance Trust,,,,,,,"Trust ownership is considered for all current and future life insurance otherwise owned by this client.
Life insurance trusts may be established for a variety of estate planning purposes, including:

To provide security for an Ideal Client's family after the death of the insured while providing control over how the death proceeds are invested or distributed to their beneficiaries
To provide liquidity to your Ideal Client's estate to pay debts and obligations, such as estate taxes
Life insurance trusts may be either revocable or irrevocable
It is possible that placing life insurance in an irrevocable life insurance trust could give Ideal Clients more control over their insurance policies and the money that is paid from them. It also may reduce or even eliminate estate taxes in some parts of the world, so more of your Ideal Client's estate can go to their heirs.
Often the goal of an irrevocable life insurance trust is to reduce or eliminate estate taxes. For Ideal Clients who have a large life insurance policy, the worry is that the life insurance policy will pay out into the estate, increasing the size of the taxable estate – and the possibility that the estate may owe estate taxes.  Sometimes these life policies can be placed into an irrevocable life insurance trust so that the proceeds of the life insurance are not added to your Ideal Client's estate upon death (reducing the size of the estate for estate-tax purposes)
Life Insurance Trusts have both advantages and disadvantages, all of which will be detailed in writing as a result of considering this Deliverables Checkpoint:tm:",,Estate Planner,,,,
1.21021E+15,Financial Planner,,,,,,,—,,Nominations and Deliverable Checkpoints Due,,,,
1.21021E+15,FP01  Establish Cash Reserves Amount,,,,,,,"The Cash Reserves Target amount, which is the exact amount of cash reserves needed for the unexpected, has been calculated and updated at least annually and spot-checked every four months.  Also referred to as Emergency Fund or Contingency Fund.",,Financial Planner,,,,
1.21021E+15,FP05  Establish Strategy for the Purchase of Next Major Asset,,,,,,,"Point of View (POV): You should be aware of the target date and timing of discussions prior to every major purchase by a client as well as client goals and reach-out to Ideal Clients prior to every goal target date (at the preceding client progress meetings).  Note this client's next major purchase and schedule those discussions on The Greatest Probability Strategy:tm: (GPS).
Ensure that the study of the quickest, least expensive and time saving method of acquiring the next major purchase (e.g. vehicle sales process) has been recommended to this client well in-advance of every major purchase.
Smaller goals may be discussed just two client progress meetings prior to the goal target date.  Certain ""huge"" goals, such as ""financial independence"" require substantially longer lead-time to set up the goal funding distributions.  Your job is to set the number of meetings prior to the goal target date that goal funding distributions discussions need to begin.  Once set, document these planned discussions on both The Greatest Probability Strategy:tm: (GPS) and The Goal Blueprint:tm: for each goal.
Your Tax Planning Subject Matter Expert is the back-up for this checkpoint because there are often tax issues which need to be considered prior to many major purchases
You have an opportunity here to make life easier for your clients, as Financial Planning Subject Matter Expert do a little research and use your skill, experience and special knowledge to document a process for each of the following scenarios using The Best Way:tm: method:
    Vehicle purchasing (discussed more specifically in 8D8 & 7V6)
    Boat purchasing
    Recreational Vehicle purchasing
    Vacation or 2nd home purchasing
    Jewelry purchasing
    Fine Art / Collectible purchasing
    Private Jet travel program purchasing
etc. etc.",,Financial Planner,,,,
1.21021E+15,FP07  Actions from the Debt Reduction Plan Added to the Implementation Plan,,,,,,,"The smartest payoff schedule has been created and is updated at least every twelve (12) months to establish that the plan is being followed (client accountability).
If a recommendation is made to make payments other than specified by the debt agreement, specific recommended payment amounts for each specific debt are clearly described on The Greatest Probability Strategy:tm:.
If there is a recommendation to make payments other than specified by the debt agreement, the new recommended payment amounts for each specific debt are clearly described on The Greatest Probability Strategy:tm:; a detailed schedule of all debts are maintained on a separate document(s).",,Financial Planner,,,,
1.21021E+15,FP08  Least Complicated Account Design Established,,,,,,,"At least three times over the past year, it has been reviewed and established that the fewest number of accounts exist (simplicity) necessary to accomplish the results outlined in the comprehensive written lifetime financial strategy.",,Financial Planner,,,,
1.21021E+15,"FP11  ""Projected"" vs. ""Actual"" Spending Reviewed",,,,,,,"A review has been made comparing the ""actual figures"" with the ""previously projected figures."" An impact review of “actual v. projected” inflows & outflows (e.g. planned and unplanned personal income & expenditures) has been performed within the past 12 months (spot-checked prior to every Client Progress Meeting) to determine if revenues and expenses are on-track or off-track as compared to the most recent personal expense projection provided by this client.",,Financial Planner,,,,
1.21021E+15,FP14  Collateral Values Established,,,,,,,"All Collateral for debts have been studied, checking loan to value requirements within the loan agreement, at least annually. Check for market risk: Is there any risk that a reduction in the values of collateral could trigger a need for increased collateral or other problems?
NOTE: If assets are pledged as collateral the loan document, or debt agreement, may specify the frequency and means for valuing the collateral.  If collateral values drop, then the loan agreement may require additional collateral.  Proactive planning will eliminate any surprises (unexpected request for additional collateral).",,Financial Planner,,,,
1.21021E+15,FP16  Minimum Cash Levels Calculated for Each Account,,,,,,,"Point of View (POV): Several accounts for this client may have ""cash equivalent"" balances within them.  We need to be certain that the cash balances in those accounts are at the level required (for planned distributions, as a part of the investment asset allocation, etc).  To ensure the right amount of ""cash"" is in each account, we will set a target amount for ""cash"" in every one of these accounts.  We'll call this target cash balance the ""par level"" since the balance will often vary above & below that target amount.
Deliverables Checkpoint:tm:
The proper amount of “cushion”, cash (or cash equivalents), needed in each and every financial asset account (including the checking (operating) accounts, has been calculated and funded within the past four months.
If regular or systematic withdrawals are being made from any account ensure there is adequate ""cash"" in each account to cover those distributions until the next cash ""par level"" review. EXAMPLE: ""If an account has a monthly systematic withdrawal established and there is not enough cash to fulfill those automatic monthly withdrawals prior to the next review, like this, of the cash-par levels, then the cash target for this hypothetical account needs to be increased to accommodate the automatic withdrawals as well as an action item to actually increase the ""cash"" in that account to the new target par level""
Definition of ""Par Level"": A term often used in inventory accounting, ""par level"" is the specified amount of inventory an enterprise wishes to have at a certain location.  In this context, think of every financial account belonging to this client as a certain location where there exists and inventory of, often various, holdings.  The inventory could be stocks, bonds, mutual funds, Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs), Index funds, and cash (or cash equivalents).  Some accounts only hold cash (or cash equivalents). So the ""Cash"" Par-level for this account is the ""cash"" target amount set by the Subject Matter Expert for each account to be able to determine quickly whether each account possesses sufficient ""cash""  until the next ""Cash"" Par-level review.",,Financial Planner,,,,
1.21021E+15,"FP17  Verify No ""Identity Theft"" has Occurred",,,,,,,"Deliverables Checkpoint:tm:
Identity theft risk has been evaluated by an Insurance Subject Matter Expert (SME) within the past 12 months.
Definition:
""Identity Theft"" is the fraudulent acquisition and use of a person's private identifying information, usually for financial gain. ""Identity Theft"" is the crime of obtaining the personal or financial information of another person for the sole purpose of assuming that person's name or identity in order to make transactions or purchases.
NOTE: Analyze suitable services available to alert to potential ""Identity Theft"" problems in ""real time.""",,Financial Planner,,,,
1.21021E+15,FP18  Credit Reports Checked for Inaccuracy & Fraud,,,,,,,"Point of View (POV): If ever this client needs to borrow money an exceptional credit report will result in lower interest rates.  Since any errors on the credit report or fraudulent use of this client's credit will serve as demerits staining this client's credit reputation, an annual spot-check of the credit report is called-for.
Also, if any individual, or business entity, owes this client a significant amount of money then that person's credit rating should be spot-checked to re-assess our confidence that the money will be repaid.
Deliverables Checkpoint:tm:
    Credit reports have been reviewed for errors and fraud protection within the past twelve months.
Reports should be reviewed for every person or entity for which funding is anticipated for future goals.",,Financial Planner,,,,
1.21021E+15,FP19  Confirm Future Income Streams,,,,,,,"Within the past year (16+ months when possible), due diligence has been thoughtfully performed on the veracity and integrity of all sources of future income streams anticipated by the plan (specific amounts and frequency of payments) with contingency strategies being developed to increase safety in the event any projected income (utilized in the lifetime capital projection) becomes unavailable.",,Financial Planner,,,,
1.21021E+15,FP20  Cash Reserves Plan Includes Insurance Deductibles,,,,,,,"Point of View (POV): If recommended by our Insurance Subject Matter Expert, we are comfortable with increasing the deductibles on all insurance policies because we fund the cash reserves accounts with additional amounts for all insurance deductibles and ""waiting periods.""
Deliverables Checkpoint:tm:
The optimal amount has been calculated and funded annually as a part of cash reserves to fund potential insurance deductibles, but utilized only if triggered by a loss.",,Financial Planner,,,,

    Trade (buy or sell) settlements
