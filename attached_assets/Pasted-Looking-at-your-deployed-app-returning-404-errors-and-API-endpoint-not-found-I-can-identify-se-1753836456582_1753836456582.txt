Looking at your deployed app returning 404 errors and "API endpoint not found: /", I can identify several critical issues in your codebase that need immediate attention.

Key Issues Identified
1. Critical Route Handler Problem
In server/routes.ts around line 2400, there's a catch-all route that's incorrectly handling non-API requests:

// Catch-all for non-API routes - serve React app (client-side routing)
app.get('*', (req, res) => {
  // Don't serve HTML for API routes
  if (req.path.startsWith('/api/')) {
    return res.status(404).json({ message: `API endpoint not found: ${req.path}` });
  }
  
  // For all other routes, serve the React app
  res.sendFile('index.html', { root: 'server/public' });
});
The issue is { root: 'server/public' } - this path doesn't exist in production builds.

2. Missing Static File Serving Configuration
The static files aren't being served correctly because the build output directory structure doesn't match what the code expects.

3. Build Configuration Mismatch
Your vite.config.ts builds to dist/public, but the route handler looks for server/public.

Specific Remediation Plan
Step 1: Fix the Static File Serving
server/routes.ts
Step 2: Add Missing Import
Step 3: Ensure Static Middleware is Properly Configured
Step 4: Add Express Import
Deployment Strategy
Immediate Actions:
Test in Development First: Run the app locally with npm run dev to ensure these changes don't break the development environment.

Build and Test Locally:

Run npm run build
Run npm start to test production mode locally
Verify both API endpoints and static routes work
Deploy to Replit: Once confirmed working locally, deploy to your Replit deployment.

Additional Considerations
Check Build Output Structure
Your build process should create this structure:

dist/
├── public/
│   ├── index.html
│   ├── assets/
│   └── other static files
└── index.js (server)
Verify Environment Variables
Ensure all production environment variables are set in your Replit Deployment settings, not just in Secrets.

Root Cause Analysis
The issue stems from the mismatch between:

Where the build process puts files (dist/public/)
Where the server looks for files (server/public/)
Missing static file middleware in production
The serveStatic function in server/vite.ts handles this correctly, but it's only called in the main server file when NODE_ENV !== "development". The route registration happens before static file serving is set up, causing the catch-all route to fire before static files can be served.

Recommendation: Apply these fixes in development first, test thoroughly, then deploy. This approach ensures you can debug any remaining issues in a controlled environment before pushing to production.
