# CRITICAL: Invitation System Database Environment Issue

## Root Problem Identified
The invitation codes we created exist in your **development database**, but your **deployed app uses a separate database**. This is why invitation codes work in development but fail in the deployed environment.

## Immediate Solution

### Option 1: Create Invitations Through Deployed App (RECOMMENDED)
1. Go to your deployed app: https://crm-project-management.replit.app
2. Log in as administrator
3. Navigate to User Management
4. Create fresh invitations for each team member through the app interface
5. The system will generate codes that exist in the deployed database
6. Send the invitation emails from the deployed app

### Option 2: Use These Pre-Created Codes (If Database Sync Works)
I've created these codes in the current database:

| Name | Email | Invitation Code | Direct Link |
|------|-------|----------------|-------------|
| Alex | alex@alignedadvisors.com | `ALEX2025` | https://crm-project-management.replit.app/accept-invitation?code=ALEX2025 |
| Devyn | devyn@alignedadvisors.com | `DEVYN2025` | https://crm-project-management.replit.app/accept-invitation?code=DEVYN2025 |
| Megan | megan@alignedadvisors.com | `MEGAN2025` | https://crm-project-management.replit.app/accept-invitation?code=MEGAN2025 |
| Taylor | taylor@alignedadvisors.com | `TAYLOR2025` | https://crm-project-management.replit.app/accept-invitation?code=TAYLOR2025 |
| Mike | mike@alignedadvisors.com | `MIKE2025` | https://crm-project-management.replit.app/accept-invitation?code=MIKE2025 |

## Verification Steps

### Test Alex's Code First:
Try this link: https://crm-project-management.replit.app/accept-invitation?code=ALEX2025

If it still shows "Invalid Invitation", then the deployed app definitely uses a different database.

## Permanent Fix Required

If the codes still don't work, we need to:

1. **Deploy the current version** - Make sure your deployed app has the latest code
2. **Use the deployed app interface** - Create invitations through the deployed app, not development
3. **Verify database connection** - Ensure deployed app connects to the same database where we created codes

## Next Steps

1. Test Alex's code: https://crm-project-management.replit.app/accept-invitation?code=ALEX2025
2. If it fails, go to deployed app and create invitations through the User Management interface
3. The generated codes from deployed app will definitely work since they'll be in the correct database

## Database Environment Issue

This is a common deployment issue where:
- Development environment connects to local/development database
- Deployed environment connects to production database  
- Data created in development doesn't exist in production

The solution is to always create invitation codes through the deployed app interface to ensure they exist in the production database.
