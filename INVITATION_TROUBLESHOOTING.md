# ClientHub Invitation Troubleshooting Guide

If you're having trouble with your invitation code, here are the most common solutions:

## 1. Check the Invitation Code

- **Make sure you copied the entire code**: Invitation codes are exactly 23 characters long (like: `12b05dkrx7im2gugg56v2rs`)
- **Remove any extra spaces**: Copy and paste can sometimes add spaces before or after the code
- **Check for typos**: Make sure every character is exactly as provided

## 2. Current Valid Invitation Codes

Here are the currently active invitation codes:

- **Devyn (devyn@mydeliverablesteam.com)**: `12b05dkrx7im2gugg56v2rs`
- **Devyn (devyn@alignedadvisors.com)**: `6bskxlrkq9x6urezufce`

4. If valid, you'll see invitation details
5. Log in with your Replit account when prompted

## 4. Common Issues

### "Invalid Invitation" Error
- **Double-check the code**: Make sure it matches exactly
- **Try copy/paste**: Instead of typing, copy the code directly
- **Clear browser cache**: Try incognito/private browsing mode
- **Check expiration**: Codes expire after 7 days

### Browser Issues
- **Try a different browser**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, etc.
- **Disable browser extensions**: Ad blockers can sometimes interfere
- **Clear cookies and cache**: Old data might cause conflicts

### Account Issues
- **Use the invitation link provided**: Click the "Create Account & Join" button in your invitation email
- **Enter your invitation code**: You must provide the invitation code during registration
- **Use the correct email**: The invitation is tied to a specific email address

## 5. If Nothing Works

Contact the administrator who sent your invitation. They can:
- Send a new invitation code
- Check if your original code is still valid
- Verify you're using the correct email address

## 6. Direct Registration Method

You can also access the registration page directly with your code:
[Your App URL]/auth?invitation=YOUR_CODE_HERE&tab=register

Replace `YOUR_CODE_HERE` with your actual invitation code. This will take you directly to the registration page with your invitation code pre-filled.
